# Basic-Light-Behavior
Simulating reflection, refraction and color absorption of light in Unity

This project was meant to be a learning experience to get acquinted with Unity. This is one of my first ever Unity projects.

Goal: To simulate some very basic light behavior including reflection, refraction and color absorption using line renderer.

Things I learnt: Working with LineRenderer and a little bit of maths related to light.
